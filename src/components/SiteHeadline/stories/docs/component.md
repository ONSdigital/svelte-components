A simplified Reuters Graphics headline, loosely modelled off our dotcom site.

Styles for this headline are intentionally restricted. It is meant to serve as a unifying style for quick-turnaround, usually shorter breaking news pages.

```svelte
<script>
  import { SiteHeadline } from '@reuters-graphics/graphics-components';
</script>

<SiteHeadline hed="{'Reuters Graphics Interactive'}" />
```
