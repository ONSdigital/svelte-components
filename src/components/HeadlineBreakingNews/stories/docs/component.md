Reuters Graphics headline for breaking news pages

This is a simplified version of the `Headline` component. It doesn't allow for the addition of crown, the dek is removed, and the styles are
simplified. It is meant to serve as a unifying style for quick turnaround pages.

```svelte
<script>
  import { HeadlineBreakingNews } from '@reuters-graphics/graphics-components';
</script>

<Headline hed="{'Reuters Graphics Interactive'}" />
```
