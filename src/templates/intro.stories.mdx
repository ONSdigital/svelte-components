# Templates

This section includes a series of starter templates constructed from multiple components within this library. These will include a feature/scrolly article, an embedded interactive and various standard pages.

When using these templates, you will need to import the **main.css** file from this library, which is best imported to your top-level `+layout.svelte` file in Svelte Kit. By doing this, you will not need to include it on individual pages.

```html
<!-- /src/routes/+layout.svelte -->
<script>
  import "@onsvisual/svelte-components/css/main.css";
</script>

<slot />
```
