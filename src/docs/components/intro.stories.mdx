# Components

The components in this section represent the components you're most likely to use when you make your page. They can be used in any Svelte-based project, but many of the demos are specifically written for use in the Graphics Kit.

If you haven't already, check out the Guides section for more info on how to read the docs and use these components before you dive in.
