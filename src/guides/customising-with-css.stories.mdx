# Customising components with CSS

One of the most powerful ways to customise components isn't props or, even, Svelte.

<p class="paragraph">
  <span class="highlight bold">It's CSS and your web inspector!</span>
</p>

## How to do it

There are a few ways to override CSS rules in a Svelte app. The simplest and most blunt is to add an additional global **app.css** file at will override the rules defined in the svelte-components **main.css** file.

You can import this file _after_ your main.css in your top level +layout.svelte file.

```html
<!-- /src/routes/+layout.svelte -->
<script>
  import "@onsvisual/svelte-components/css/main.css";
  import "../app.css"; // This path depends on where you place your file
</script>
```

## Targetting a specific component

If you want to override the CSS a specific instance of a component, you have the option to wrap it with an HTML div and apply the style you want via that element's class.

```html
<div class="my-section">
  <section />
</div>

<style>
  /* You can inherited properties and CSS variables like this */
  .my-section {
    background: red;
    color: blue;
    --link: green;
  }
  /* If you want to override CSS that's buried within the component, you need to use Svelte's :global syntax */
  .my-section :global(h2) {
    color: white;
  }
</style>
```

## Still not working?

If you're pretty sure you've got the CSS right, but it still doesn't seem to override the style of the component, you may need to add an [!important](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/important) declaration.
