A wrapper component for robo projects. The only prop for charts is `section`. The keys and values in the `section` object is created from the pug file so you'll have to edit what's in that to change what gets passed to the charts.

Note: This component is part of the **@onsvisual/svelte-charts** library. See [more examples here](https://onsvisual.github.io/svelte-charts/).

```html
<script>
  import { Chart } from "@onsvisual/svelte-charts";

  //the section is normally generated by the pug file
  const section = {
  "id": "chart-density",
  "type": "Chart",
  "chartType": "bar",
  "title": "Densest local authorities in the South East, 2020",
  "footer": "Source: Office for National Statistics",
  "data": [
        {

    ],
