An indented block of large text, designed to sit inside a `<Section>` block. Adding an "attribution" text will make it appear as a quote.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<script>
  import { Blockquote } from "@onsvisual/svelte-components";
</script>

<Blockquote attribution="A. Person">Some quoted text.</Blockquote>
```
